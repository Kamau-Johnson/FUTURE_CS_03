## Task 3: Cybersecurity Incident Response Report
As part of my Cyber Security journey, I worked on Task 3: Simulated Cyber Incident Response, an in-depth investigation into an unauthorized access and data breach scenario. This project focused on identifying security vulnerabilities, analyzing attack patterns, and implementing effective mitigation strategies.

### Key Highlights of the Incident Response:
✔ Real-Time Detection – Leveraged SIEM tools like Splunk, Kibana, and Wireshark to analyze and visualize security logs.
✔ Forensic Investigation – Tracked attacker activities, uncovering a brute-force attack and unauthorized data exfiltration.
✔ Incident Containment – Executed security measures such as account lockouts, firewall restrictions, and system patching to neutralize threats.
✔ Security Awareness – Implemented phishing prevention strategies and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to reduce future risks.

### Skills Developed:
🔹 Cyber Threat Analysis – Investigated unauthorized access and brute-force attacks using forensic tools.
🔹 SIEM & Network Security – Utilized Splunk, Kibana, and Wireshark for log analysis and anomaly detection.
🔹 Incident Response Planning – Applied structured containment, mitigation, and prevention strategies.
🔹 Security Best Practices – Strengthened authentication mechanisms and enhanced phishing awareness training.

### Learning Experience:
This project provided real-world exposure to cybersecurity operations and enhanced my ability to:

✔ Analyze security logs to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
✔ Correlate attack patterns using SIEM tools to identify vulnerabilities.
✔ Develop security protocols to mitigate threats and safeguard sensitive data.

# Why This Project Matters for Future Interns?
In today’s digital landscape, cyber threats are more prevalent than ever. This project equips Future Interns with:
